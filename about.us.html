              <h3>1961</h3>
              <p>It all began in 1961, the year the World Wildlife Fund (now World Wide Fund for Nature) was founded. At that time, a giant panda named Chi-Chi lived at the London Zoo. It was one of the only pandas in the Western world and its popularity was immense. Its clumsy and charming appearance attracted crowds of visitors and great media attention.</p>

              <h3>1971</h3>
              <p>The first campaign to protect the wolf was born in Italy. In 1971 the WWF launched Operation San Francesco for the conservation of the wolf in Italy, obtaining the  
              protection of the species and saving it from extinction. There are perhaps 1500 wolves that live today between the Alps and 
              Apennines.  Still a lot, a lot of few. Yet every year shameless and criminal poaching kills them 
              hundreds: carcasses of killed and poisoned wolves, hanged and strangled are found throughout Italy 
              clearly demonstrating how our species is incapable of sharing spaces with animals not only wonderful but also crucial for the balance of forests and countryside.

              <h3>2005</h3>
              <p>In 2005, the WWF Italy Foundation was created, which will form the Association's “safe”, the Association's asset management tool. In 2005, the WWF achieved another historic success: it has in fact
 systematically invested in international cooperation, and thus obtained recognition as an NGO - Non-Governmental Organization from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a fact that accredits and enables us to design and activate projects in developing countries well beyond the levels of support to which WWF Italy historically contributed to the international family.</p>

              <p>Launch of major campaigns for the protection of the oceans and the fight against climate change. Every spring, hundreds of blue whales gather off Guafo to raise their young. Yacqueline Montecinos of WWF Chile is working to establish a so-called indigenous protected area around Guafo. There, the Mapuche should be able to return to live according to their traditions and in harmony with nature. This will also benefit the blue whales and thus the climate. </p>

      <p>Paris Agreement: WWF contributes to first global climate treaty. The first binding period under the Paris Climate Agreement, which replaces the Kyoto Protocol, begins on January 1°, 2021. This is a significant change: all nations now have their own climate goals. Climate protection projects abroad are therefore considered to contribute to improving the host country's climate budget, and thus to achieving the host country's national climate goals under the Paris Climate Agreement. Many states' climate protection projects rely on such additional funding, which can help them achieve their goals or pursue ambitious climate goals in the future.</p>

      <h3>2020</h3>
      <p>WWF collaborated with the Abruzzo National Park for the planting of hundreds of fruit trees to limit the dispersion of bears in unprotected areas and attempt to reduce the number of specimens hit by cars. Over 90 new acoustic and visual deterrents along the roads of Abruzzo to protect the Marsican brown bears. The security devices near the Protected Natural Areas populated by the bears were installed by WWF Italy experts. As soon as the animals approach the roadway, the technological instruments, through sounds and lights, will signal the dangers associated with the passage of cars, trucks, and motorcycles. </p>

      <h3>2024</h3>
      <p>WWF will continue to support ambitious goals to stop biodiversity loss and address climate change. Worldwide, over 6000 collaborators spread across more than 100 countries work together to achieve six global goals: manage and protect seas for the benefit of humans and various species; improve the conditions of the most important forests on the planet; commit to a future based on fair principles and renewable energy; ensure freshwater ecosystems continue to serve humans and nature; stabilize and further expand populations of key threatened species; guarantee a global food system that does not deplete the planet's resources. </p>
